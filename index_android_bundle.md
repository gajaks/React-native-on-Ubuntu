# React-native-on-Ubuntu


installing and running react native in ubuntu

follow the link:
http://www.proreactnative.com/Getting-Started-with-React-Native-on-Ubuntu-Linux/

and at the last 

the line Which says


Did it fail?

OK, try this:
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081

while running the above command your emulator or the mobile you connected should be removed.

or else you get 
unable to load script from assets index.android.bundle 
error.


thankyou
